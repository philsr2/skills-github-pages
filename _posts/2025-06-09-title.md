Asked ChatGPT for a way to use a middleware to serve static files by domain 
and a show a 404 error when pages aren't found.

Be the 3rd iteration, I had a working bit of code to now add to my actual
website.

WebApps in Go are so easy to write, even with a fair amount of editing to add
some debug lines, logging and setting my domain names, easy peasy.  Simple code
simple examples, and lots of learning.
