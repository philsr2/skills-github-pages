Didn't have my F42 vm fully configured for cms3 yet.  Added my desktop IP, the vm IP and my iphone IP 
to the auth subroutine.

Really need to make an /api call for adding allowed IPs 

I think rather than putting a Go/Fiber wiki on my server, I'll try running it from my F42 vm first 
Now to try an iphone postgresql app, see if I can see it any better.  Might need to fiddle some table 
view for mobile format on my server.  Cms3 will already display any table i pick (need to reject viewing
the system tables like pages and user_data lol)
